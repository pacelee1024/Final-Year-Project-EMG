Please follow the following instructions for the proper results:

1. To test with this Desktop please use the 9-pin adapter not the USB adapter as it is not working with it. 
2. Start the computrainer 3d software, track can be loaded or you can create a new track, in the options please select the option to save the rider performance.
3. I would insist that you use the existing settings.
4. To start the session you can start by pressing the button F1, on the device attached to the cycle itself or it can be started by pressing the button G from the keyboard.
5. After the session is over please do not forget to save the rider performance report.
6. Next step is to open the ComputrainerCS 1.6 present on the desktop, in that first from the source menu select the saved file option, which I have already done. 
7. Next step is from File-> Export ( Please see that in Export options select Time and power only) and also untick Auto Export and Comma Delimited.
8. After that save the file ( C:\\CompuTrainer 3D V3\\Rider Performance\\lastperf.3dp) and save the report.
9. Next step is to open the eclipse luna and just run the code and data will be sent to the http server.
